# 网络层、传输层

网络层：

- send and receive packets
- Determine the best routes that messages should take from one end system to another
- Routing protocols
- Load balancing



传输层：

- Segment large data chunks to smaller chunks (datagrams or segments)
- Add additional information as the header or tailer to the segment/datagram to make segment/datagram tramsmission reliable.
  - e.g. checksum.
